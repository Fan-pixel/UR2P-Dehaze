# UR2P-Dehaze: Learning a Simple Image Dehaze Enhancer via Unpaired Rich Physical Prior

Abstract
===========================
Image dehazing techniques aim to enhance contrast and restore details, which are essential for preserving visual information and improving image processing accuracy. \textcolor{red}{Existing methods may struggle to capture the physical characteristics of images fully and deeply, which could limit their ability to reveal image details.} To overcome this limitation, we propose an unpaired image dehazing network, called the Simple Image Dehaze Enhancer via Unpaired Rich Physical Prior (UR2P-Dehaze). First, to accurately estimate the illumination, reflectance, and color information of the hazy image, we design a Shared Prior Estimator (SPE) that is iteratively trained to ensure the consistency of illumination and reflectance, generating clear, high-quality images. Additionally, a self-monitoring mechanism is introduced to eliminate undesirable features, providing reliable priors for image reconstruction. Next, we propose Dynamic Wavelet Separable Convolution (DWSC), which effectively integrates key features across both low and high frequencies, significantly enhancing the preservation of image details and ensuring global consistency. Finally, to effectively restore the color information of the image, we propose an Adaptive Color Corrector that addresses the problem of unclear colors. The PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID and CIEDE2000 metrics on the benchmark dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. It also contributes to the performance improvement of downstream tasks.
